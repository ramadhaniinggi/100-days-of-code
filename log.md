# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 18, 2020 
##### Learned bootstrap

**Today's Progress**: Made the home menu, collected images, and fixed CSS

**Thoughts:** I struggled with center img in anchor using bootstrap. I knew how to do it with css, but haven't figured it out if I used bootstrap classes.
